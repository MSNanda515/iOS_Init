Plan
iOS tutorial, Exercise, Speaking, Simran,  CP, C++, Email to Scott, Research on images,  Apply to professors. 

- Geometry view: Tool to postion the view
  Rectangle()
  GeometryReader {geo in} // for relative postioning
- EnvironmentObject: used to pass down objects down to hierarchy of views, good practice since only one copy of the data needs to be maintained



- //MARK: Section, adds section division and can be useful to explore the project
